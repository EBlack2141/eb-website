        <span class="imagedesctext">When I first saw les miserables, I was shown the 10th Anniversary edition and
            I didn't really give it a chance. It took me a few times listening to certain songs on Youtube before I finally
            sat down and watched the whole thing again, fully invested this time. Since then, it has been by far my favourite
            musical of all time. The cast is known as the dream cast for a reason. Colm Wilkinson is the original Jean
            Valjean and his performance in this edition is truly remarkable. So many of the cast members in this special
            are my absolute favourites for the role, including Philip Quast as Javert, Michael Ball as Marius and Alun Armstrong
            as Th√©nardier to name a few.</span>

        <span class="imagedesctext">I barely missed being able to watch the 25th anniversary live. My uncle had bought tickets
        	to go see but I was in school at the time and wasn't able to make it. Fortunately enough, they produced a DVD of the
        	production as they did the 10th anniversary so I was able to at least see where I would have been seated had I gone.
        	This performance was absolutely brilliant, Alfie boe made an excellent Jean Valjean and Norm Lewis made an excellent
        	Javert. I even prefer certain cast members over their 10th anniversary counterparts, like Ramin Karimloo as Enjolras
        	and Samantha Barks as Eponine. Samantha's rendition of On my own is tied with being my favourite song next to
        	Colm Wilkinson's bring him home.
