        <p>Welcome to my website! I have seen a lot of musicals over my life, starting from when I was a small child being taken to see
            starlight express at the Royal Albert Hall. Since then I have been a huge fan of musicals and musical theatre 
            continues to be a big passion of mine.

        <p id="footertext">Choosing two musicals to be featured on this website was a hard choice as I love so many
            different musicals, for many different reasons. I chose these two because I have never grown weary of 
            listening to their music, and they easily had the biggest impact on me. Coming in extremely close behind
             was sweeney todd as it is probably my favourite musical at the moment. I adore it's black comedy and catchy numbers
            but in the larger picture, Les Mis and Phantom have to be my all time favourites.
