        <span class="imagedesctext">I was first introduced to Phantom of the opera  via the 25th anniversary DVD. Ramin Karimloo
        	and Sierra Bogges were amazing and if they had been in any other production I'm sure they would've made that musical
        	my favourite as well. The entire cast were the best that I have seen them and if any performer had been replaced
        	it wouldn't have been the lightning in a bottle performance that it was. My favourite songs of Phantom in general are
        	Music of the night, Down once more, and Wishing you were somehow here again. Each of these songs pinpoint key moments
        	in the musical, With Music of the night being the height of the Phantom's plans for Christine, and down once more
        	being the moment things spiral out of control for him and his life comes crashing down around him. Wishing you were
        	somehow here again is Christine's turning point from being deathly afraid of the phantom, to facing her fears and
        	deciding to work with Raul and the other's to bring him down.

        <span class="imagedesctext">In 2017 I saw Phantom of the opera live for the first time. It was absolutely amazing
        	and the Phantom was played by John Owen Jones who is both my second favourite Phantom AND Jean Valjean in Les Miserables.
        	It was truly an amazing stroke of luck that I got to see him and the performance was astounding from all the cast.
        	For this production they were using a new type of revolving set that rotated between different scenes. Unfortunately
        	though, they no longer include the dropping chandelier part of the performance which I have always wanted to see live.
        	For those who don't know, most Phantom performances rig the chandelier of theatre above the audience to drop around 15 meters
        	when the Phantom cuts it in the musical out of wrath. Overall though, the experience was truly magical and I would 
            love to see it again.
